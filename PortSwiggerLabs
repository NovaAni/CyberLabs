Lab: Path Traversal 
1. Objective:  This lab contains a path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.
            To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file. 
2. Reconnaissance: We use BurpSuite to moderate the traffic generated from opening the lab link either using the built-in chromium browser or via the foxy proxy extension 
                   We observe that we obtain a list of .jpg requests coming from the website 
3. Exploitation: We then choose one of the .jpg files and sent the to the Repeater via. Proxy tab. 
                 After we have sent it to the Repeater tab we change the filename to: ../../../etc/passwd
                 We click send 
4. Observation: We notice that we have completed the first lab as we successfully acquired the contents of the /etc/passwd file
