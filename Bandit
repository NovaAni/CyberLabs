--Level 0--
Step 1: We start by connecting to the required shell by the command: ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220
Step 2: Password given is bandit0 which we enter and we enter into our first level of the game 
Step 3: Using ls we find all the sublists present in the current working directory (cwd) i.e: ls
Step 4: We see that there is a file called "readme" by which we can access using the cat command: cat readme 
Step 5: You attain the password to proceed 
Step 6: Enter the exit command to reconnect to your 1st Level by the ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220 [This step is repeated after completion of every level]
[Make sure to make a separate file in your system that stores the passwords as they aren't automatically saved in the game]

--Level 1-- 
Step 1: We know that the password for the next level is in the - file
Step 2: We must use ls command to access the lists of files and directories 
Step 3: We observe the - file present 
Step 5: We cannot execute: cat - as "-" is a special character 
Step 6: We have to find the contents inside - file by including the full path of the - file
Step 7: Command for that would be ./- 
. -> directory path till that point wrt / 
/ -> the path introduction to the upcoming file name 
- > name of the file 
Step 8: We obtain the password for the next level 

--Level 2-- 
Step 1: We see that the file has spaces in its name which is also treated as a special character 
Step 2: ls command 
Step 3: We find a file with the name "--spaces in this filename--"
Step 4: WKT, "-" and " " are special characters 
Step 5: We cant access them via the cat --spaces in this filename--
Step 6: We have to include the full path of the directory similar to Level 1 BUT here as there are consecuite hyphens and spaces this is treated as a separate command
Step  7: Hence whilst including the filename we enclose it with the "" to access the file
Step 8: Command: cat ./"--spaces in this filename--" 
Step 9: We get the pasword and we proceed to Level 3

--Level 3-- 
Step 1: We see that the password is stored in a HIDDEN FILE with the dir name "inhere" 
Step 2: ls command
Step 3: We see the inhere directory, to access it we must make that the current directory by the command: cd inhere
Step 4: ls command [gives us no result] so we must modify this by using the command: ls -a [-a refers to all files irrespective of type, visibility etc] 
Step 5: We find a cheeky file named "...Hiding-From-You" hehe
Step 6: We can access it by the command: cat ./"...Hiding-From-You" and we retrieve the password for Level 4

--Level 4-- 
Step 1: The password is stored in the human-readable file in the dir named "inhere" 
Step 2: ls -> inhere directory 
Step 3: cd inhere
Step 4: ls command once more 
Step 5: We spot all the files inside the inhere directory
Step 6: To filter out the files of different types with the human readable ones we must understand what human readables file refer to
#Human readable refer to files that consist of ASCII characters 
Step 7: To filter we must include that condition recursively to all the files in the inhere directory
Step 8: Command to do that: file ./* | grep ASCII
#grep
